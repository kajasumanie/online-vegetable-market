1.	Introduction

1.	Background to the domain

‘Online vegetable Market’ is a web based application proposed with the vision of lifting the daily lives of famers as well as people who lives in that particular surrounding. In villages famers put lots of effort to sell their good to intermediary people who buy their good at low price. Moreover the profit that they gained through this deal could not compensate transportation cost and energy that they spend to sell their goods.  Human race is at its peak in technological development and people are trying hard to uplift human life style. ‘Online Vegetable Market’ is a small contribution from our side.

We are planning to use SQL database. We are also planning to use SQL server management studio.

2.	Feasibility

•	Economic Feasibility
Our application is economically feasible because except for the software development and maintenance costs there are no expenses (like hardware). In the implementation process, famers have to enter their product quantity into the system(not costly).

•	Technological Feasibility
Our project is also technologically feasible because the technical knowhow that is required is very minimum. Entering data is the only technical part that is required. The user friendly GUI will facilitate exploring the application. Bilingual GUI helps farmer to input data correctly.

•	Resource Feasibility
The main resource that we need is the development team (human resource) which we already have. Hardware components are not required for our project.

•	Necessary security measures will be taken to protect privacy of the users and security of data.
